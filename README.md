# HarvestPythonExtract
Using Python 3.X to pull data from Harvest API and send directly to SQL Server Database

The .py File is a simple script to connect to Harvest API and create a connection to SQL Server.
The variables can be sourced in various manners but I left many parts hard coded to make it more readable.

I have also shared the SQL Table script and the SQL Stored Procedure Script which are used in communication with the Python script.
